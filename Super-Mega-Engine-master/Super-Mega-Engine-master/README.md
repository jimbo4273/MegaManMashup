[How To](https://github.com/rafaelcp/Open-Mega-Engine/wiki/How-To)

# Goals
- Ideally, the engine should be an empty game, and levels, weapons and bosses (from examples or created by the user) should be added by the user according to his individual game 
- It should be possible to replicate any of the 8-bit MM games with the engine
